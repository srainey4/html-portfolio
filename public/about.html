<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 27 year old aspiring web developer. I currently work in finance and I'm looking to pivot careers into something that
  overlaps the creative and the technical. I've wanted to learn how to do this kind of thing for a long time and I feel like
  I'm finally getting a handle on it. It's lots of fun.</p>

<p>in my free time, I enjoy playing hockey, playing guitar, talking tech with my friends, reading, and spending time with my 
  lovely girlfriend and dog. They mean a lot to me and I appreciate them putting up with me while I learn how to do this thing.</p>

<p>In the future, I will be able to do all sorts of cool things with this newfound skill. For right now, I'll leave it
  as I've learnt it, although I can already see how much I'll be able to do here in the future.</p>
