<h1>Scott's Top Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My top three movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Miracle</h3>
<p>The best hockey movie of all time abut the greatest sports moment of all time. 
    I love this movie, I love Kurt Russell 
    in this movie, and I think it deserves all the praise in the world.</p>

<h3>2. Goodfellas</h3>
<p>For as long as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.<br />
<br />
I don't have much else to say about it. Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta; come on, now. It rules.<br />
<br />
Now go get your f****n' shine box.

<h3>3. Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>I love science and I love Cillian Murphy. It's incredibly beautiful and Christopher Nolan killed it. I also
    loved all the cameos from other famous actors. They all know how to kill it, eh?
